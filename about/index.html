<h2 id="hello">Hello!</h2>

<p>You have gotten to this page for a reason, and that reason is to learn more about me, so here goes:</p>

<p>I am Arseniy Kouzmenkov, a third year Computing Science Honors student at the University of Alberta.</p>

<p>For developing, I prefer to use C++ and C for larger projects, Java for Android development and Python
for small scripts. I really enjoy system development and working with low level networking. The Operating Systems
and Computer Organization and Architecture classes have been some of my favourite courses so far!</p>

<p>One of my non-programming interests is teaching. After all, when you teach others, you solidify your own
knowledge. The feeling when a person you helped does well with the knowledge you gave them is simply exhilarating.
Because of this passion, I became a Teaching Assistant for CMPUT 274 and CMPUT 275 in the 2018 / 2019 academic
year at the UofA. I spent many hours assisting students with course content and helping them further their
undestanding of what it means to be a great developer. In addition to that, during my internship with the Worker&rsquo;s
Compensation Board of Alberta, I spent a week running training sessions on the topic of Test Automation.</p>

<p>As for hobbies, I love most aquatic sports: I did competitive swimming for seven years and have Open Water PADI
certification for scuba diving. Feel free to ask me about my favourite dive sites!</p>

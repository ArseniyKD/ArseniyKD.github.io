<p><em>Business Analyst Summer Student, May 2018 - August 2018.</em>  Edmonton, AB</p>

<p>During my time at WCB Alberta, I have worked on automating their manual testing scripts using the CodedUI
Test Automation framework. Within 4 months I have successfully automated 5 smoke tests and 1 regression test,
exceeding the team&rsquo;s goal by 3 times.</p>

<p>At the end of the internship I have taken initiative and conducted training sessions that taught two different
teams how test automation can be applied to the software products that they support.</p>

<p>In addition to that, I have developed an internal website for the Business Services Coordination Team from
scratch, which is being used to this day.</p>

<p><em>Teaching Assistant for CMPUT 274 / 275, September 2018 - April 2019.</em>  Edmonton, AB</p>

<p>As a teaching assistant for CMPUT 274 / 275, I attended class time to aid students with understanding lecture
content and help out with technical issues during &ldquo;morning programming challenges&rdquo;. I also held office hours
during which students could come in to get help with further understanding the course content or get help with
assignments.</p>

<p>This class teaches Python and C++, completing most projects using an Arduino Mega board. This course is an
accelerated introduction for Honors Computing Science and Computer Engineering students.</p>

<p><em>Software Development Job Shadow, June 2017 - August 2017.</em>  Dubai, UAE.</p>

<p>During the job shadow, I was introduced to software engineering principles, version control tools, Linux OS and
database architecture. This job shadow has set me up for academic and professional success by teaching me good
software development practices and exposing me to the professional development world.</p>

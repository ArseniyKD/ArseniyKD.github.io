      <description>Hello! You have gotten to this page for a reason, and that reason is to learn more about me, so here goes:
I am Arseniy Kouzmenkov, a third year Computing Science Honors student at the University of Alberta.
For developing, I prefer to use C++ and C for larger projects, Java for Android development and Python for small scripts. I really enjoy system development and working with low level networking.</description>

<h2 id="projects">Projects</h2>

<ul>
<li><strong>Vitabu</strong>: This was our CMPUT 301 project. Vitabu is an Android app that provides users with the possibility to lend and borrow books from other users. This project was done in a group of 6 people. The project was built using Firebase. You can view this project <a href="https://github.com/cmput301w19t20/Vitabu">here.</a></li>
<li><strong>Arduino Air Hockey</strong>: This was our CMPUT 274 final group project. We made an air hockey game in C++ for the Arduino platform with a realistic physics engine. The game is played with two Arduinos, one used for playing the game and the other used to display the score. You can see the project <a href="https://github.com/ArseniyKD/AAH">here.</a></li>
<li><strong>Retro Bullet Hell</strong>: This was our CMPUT 275 final group project. We made a retro arcade style bullet hell game written in Python 3 with Pygame. The focus of the project was on efficiency, modularity and Object Oriented Design. Due to the fact that the project contains some code that was a solution to an assignment in the class, I may only show the project upon request.</li>
<li><strong>The Name of The Game</strong>: This project was created during the HackED 2018 hackathon and got third place. This is a platformer where you control the environment, and not the character. The program has an emulated terminal and a basic text editor where the player types in commands and code to control the environment. The game was meant to introduce children to basic programming concepts and dispel the fear of command line interfaces. You can see the project <a href="https://github.com/josephmeleshko/GoodQuestion-Hackathon2018">here.</a></li>
</ul>

<h2 id="competitions">Competitions</h2>

<li><strong>UofA Programming Contest 2018</strong>: Our team got 13th place in Division 1.</li>
<li><strong>Computer Programming Challenge 2017</strong>: This competition was held at Heriot-Watt University in Dubai. I have competed in this event while still in High School.</li>
